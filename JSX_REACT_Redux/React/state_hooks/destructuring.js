const { name, value } = target;
// This syntax uses object destructuring to extract the name and value properties from the target object. 
// It creates two constants named name and value and assigns the corresponding values from the target object to them.

// For example, if the target object has properties like
 { name: 'username', value: 'john_doe' },
// then after the destructuring assignment, the name constant will have the value 'username' and the value constant will have the value 'john_doe'.

// So, in this case, the name constant would hold the value of the name property from the target object,
// and the value constant would hold the value of the value property from the target object. 
// They are separate variables and hold distinct values extracted from the target object.
