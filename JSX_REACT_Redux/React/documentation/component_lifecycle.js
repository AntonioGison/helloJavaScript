/**
 * Remember the three parts of a componentâ€™s lifecycle:

Mounting, when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time
Updating, when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props, When a component updates, it calls render() and other methods
Unmounting, when the component is being removed from the DOM
