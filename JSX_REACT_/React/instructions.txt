Open up your terminal.

If you’ve previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, it is recommended that you uninstall the package first.

1.A)In your terminal run these commands:

npm uninstall -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app myfirstreactapp

1.B) If you’ve never installed create-react-app before, you can simply run this command:

npx create-react-app myfirstreactapp

(Feel free to replace myfirstreactapp with whatever name you want, as long as it doesn’t contain capital letters :-))

2) We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd myfirstreactapp
  npm start


the server started on  http://localhost:3000/

3) go to src then write in app.js and index.js (which is the entry point)

4) App.js contains the top-level component(the one you creates) and index.js renders it.
